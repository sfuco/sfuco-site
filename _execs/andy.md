Currently a third year student at SFU, Andy is working on completing his studies in Bioinformatics. When he is not being told by Rei to play quieter, you can find him in a corner watching basketball games on his phone. Andy has been playing the violin since 2002 and managed to complete the Associate of The Royal Conservatory (ARCT) Performers Examination in 2011. Previously, Andy has also played with a chamber group called The Kabok Strings for 4 years, the New Westminster Symphony Orchestra for a few months, and a weird rock/metal-classical fusion group called Plastic Acid Orchestra for one concert (theyâ€™re pretty good, and Andy knows the conductor/music director personally; check them out). As a member of SFUCO since Fall 2015, he has met many others who share his passion for music, and in the near future, Andy hopes to develop and grow the orchestra further as Vice President of SFUCO.
