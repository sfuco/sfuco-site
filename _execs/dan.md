Dan is currently pursuing a degree in Music Composition at SFU. With a strong affinity toward an abundance of musical styles from all over the world, he often revels in their unique characteristics while seeking ways to blend them. At the 2017 Taiwanfest, his arrangement of Hisaishi's "Castle in the Sky" was performed by the highly-acclaimed Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra in collaboration with SFUCO which has contributed substantially to the orchestra's progression and his personal professional development. As the Vice President & Music Arranger of the SFU Concert Orchestra, he hopes to support the orchestraâ€™s ideals of encouraging growth in eager musicians and providing a vibrant musical presence in the SFU community.
