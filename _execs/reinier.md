Reinier is a second-degree computing science student. After finishing his first degree in Psychology (Biology minor) degree at the University of Waterloo, he decided that Ontario was too cold and moved to the west coast. His ensemble music experience dates back to high school concert band where he played flute. Before joining SFUCO, Reinier was a member of the UW Concert Band Club, where he was the VP of Marketing from 2014-2015. Throughout the years at the UWCBC, he has moved increasingly towards the rear, taking up the alto and tenor saxophones and eventually finding himself in the percussion section. Beyond these, Reinier also finds himself playing guitar and piano from time to time.

As the designer for SFUCO since 2016, Reinier... designs posters for events and the concert programmes. He also handles some of the technical aspects of the club including the development of <em>this</em> website! On top of that, Reinier is also a member of the SFUCO Social Committee where he helps plan and run the various social events held during the year. He hopes to see SFUCO grow into a group that is as visually impressive as it is musically.
