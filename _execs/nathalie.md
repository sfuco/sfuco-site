Nathalie is in her sixth and final year at both SFU and SFUCO. She started on violin at the age of 8, picked up the clarinet and trombone in her high school band days, and found her calling in the community of SFU musicians in what was (at the time) the SFU Chamber Orchestra. Her immediate love for this small group of musicians inspired what would become a 5 year role on the executive team. Currently the co-president since 2014, Nathalie also served as vice-president from 2012 to 2014. Nathalie's biggest hope is that SFUCO will grow into a sustainable musical ensemble with both SFU and community recognition.

In her spare time, Nathalie can be found walking her dog, taking photographs, bird-watching, making lists, and thinking about poutine.
