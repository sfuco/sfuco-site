Lisa is a fourth year SFUCO member and Education student at SFU. She interests herself in subjects that people find are cool to hate (i.e. French and Math), which ironically makes her cool in the eyes of future employers (or so she hopes). Lisa started playing piano at the age of 5 and continued until she completed her Grade 10 RCM examinations, but has not touched the piano in a long time. She picked up flute in middle school for a year before she gave up due to her affinity for her bed in the mornings and a temperamental flute that refused to play F. With a new flute and late afternoon/evening rehearsals, she returned to playing music with others in SFUCO, picking up some (slightly doubtful) skills in percussion along the way. Most semesters, she plays what she typically terms ‘percussiflute’, but this semester she has decided to become a full member of the percussion section (which means exciting things for her stomach, and slightly less exciting things for her rest counting abilities).

Lisa is a member of the SFUCO Social Events Committee. She likens her social competency to that of a rock and consequently, is still not quite sure how she became one of the two first Social Events Coordinators when the positions were officially made in 2014. She also isn’t quite sure how it evolved into a committee, but she is very happy to have an awesome team to work with. She does, however, like planning (as an aspiring teacher would), so it is a very enjoyable and rewarding position for her. Over 6 semesters, she has helped organize a variety of events, including dinners, karaoke nights, archery tag, movie nights, skating and others. Through these events, she has come to make many friends in SFUCO, as well as an enemy of the ‘Maybe’ button on Facebook.

Lisa hopes that SFUCO will continue to grow in its instrumental variety and musical talents, and hopes to continue increasing social engagement within the club with a balance of well-loved and new event ideas.
