Rei was among the first members of the orchestra, having joined since the first rehearsal in the fall of 2007, when he was a computing science student at SFU. Since then, though he was tempted by somewhat antiquated promises of glory as a software developer and researcher, he stuck stubbornly to music, participating in any capacity possible. He briefly studied violin performance at UBC before family circumstances made it impossible to continue, and now serves as Publisher for Fraser Monthly Japanese community magazine and as a translator for Crunchyroll. He hopes to someday dust himself off and pick up the violin again, and is grateful to the orchestra for providing a place to keep the music alive.
