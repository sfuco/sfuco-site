Nikolai is in his fifth year of studying archaeology and moral philosophy at SFU, with a deep interest in the ways that archaeology can play a role in solving modern conflicts and inequalities. As Co-President of the SFU Concert Orchestra, he has enjoyed seeing the orchestra grow and change, and hopes that it will continue be a place of musical passion, growth, and diversity for many years to come.
