Rebecca joined the SFUCO in 2011 and had been playing in and out the past years.  Being part of the orchestra has allowed her to continue playing viola and learn the double bass.  To her, being able to play with so many remarkable people over the years has been absolutely fantastic, and she looks forward to seeing what the next 10 years bring.
