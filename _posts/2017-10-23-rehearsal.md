## Rehearsal Notes

<a name="rn1"/>
### Unfinished Symphony [[listen here]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfmRakIbAFk)
#### General
- Be aware of the written dynamics along with the contours of the melody, a slight degree change in dynamics can make a huge impact especially with this piece.

#### Rehearsal A
- Strings emphasize the dotted-eight & sixteenth relationship, lean towards the 16th as if there's a bit of a hiccup.
- Instruments playing the syncopated pattern, emphasize the first beat of each and <> (Sausage)

#### Bar 49
- Cellos cresc.

#### Bar 85
- Strings emphasize the sforzando.

#### Bar 185-186
- Whoever plays the runs, subito cresc. to increase the intensity.

#### Bar 194
- Make sure the ffz is DISTINCT from the following fz.

#### Bar 352
- If you're playing anything other than the quarter note, bring it out (regardless of the p, pp dynamic marking)

### Howl's Neighbour Totoro [[listen here]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSZdHx7nKdo)
#### General
- The main gripe of this piece is nailing the articulations and transitions. With an abundance of tempo changes, it's easy to become confused but Rei-sama will guide us through. (Be attentive)

#### Rehearsal A
- Cellos/Bass can go fortissisimo, and emphasize the accents.
- Cellos/Bass prolong the B (1 bar after A) and A (3 bars after A)

#### Bar 28
- Emphasize the slur articulations (Embrace the dissonance MMMM)
Trumpets don't be afraid to be a bit louder this time as the lower brass can overwhelm you.

### Mars [[listen here]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7uEyyNIT4)
*(we're still drunk on ships about to go to war but we gotta go fast)*
#### General
- We're bringing up the speed for this piece but don't lose precision! Like Unfinished, the dynamics are very significant in this piece. The dotted-eight & sixteenth/dotted-quarter & eighth relationships are important here as well, pretend you're swerving side to side. The piece is reliant on specific instrumentation as well so that will be worked out as we progress.

#### Rehearsal IV/Bar 79
â€¢ As redemption for the past, we will include the run.

#### Rehearsal VI
â€¢ Emphasize the dotted quarter/eighth combo

#### Bar 28
â€¢Transfer the energy from Rehearsal IX to Bar 28 then go full gear at Rehearsal II

#### Bar 104
â€¢ Everyone keep the momentum/power all the way through, especially for brass.

#### Bar 120
â€¢ Brass try to achieve a warmer sound (less raspy)

#### Bar 155
â€¢ Note the gradual cresc. these are different from the "<". The cresc. will persist until the 5/2 signature while the "<" indicates more of a sudden burst.

That's a wrap-up;
Next week will be Alana's pieces! Please make sure you've reviewed Howl's Moving Castle, Swan Lake, Beethoven's 5th and Oblivion (String sectional). Practice, practice, practice!
Best of luck on exams, projects, work and whatnot ðŸ˜Š
