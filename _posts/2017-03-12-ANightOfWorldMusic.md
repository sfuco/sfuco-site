SFUCO is proud to present "A Night of World Music". From Korea, to Norway, and then to England, come out and enjoy a round-trip around the world; all in the comfort of your own seat. This is also the last semester of executive leadership for our Co-President of 3 years, Nathalie Scott-Hsiung.

Light refreshments will be served at the intermission. The concert starts at 7pm, and doors open at 6:30. Admission is by donation.

Parking is available 1 level below the theatre in the Central parkade adjacent to the Maggie Benson Centre. SFU is transit-friendly and serviced by 4 different bus lines. We recommend carpooling or transiting to save gas and parking fees!

We hope to see everyone there!
