Happy Hallow's Eve, fellow musicians! ðŸŽƒ

I've come bearing this week's announcements and rehearsal notes.

<a name="announcements"/>
## Announcements
---
1. We would like to remind everyone that **if you haven't paid for your fees, do so as soon as you can**. It's $10 for one semester and $15 for two (Fall & Spring); Jenny will continue collecting them in subsequent rehearsals but you can also arrange something with Andy, Nikolai or I (Dan).


2. We want to emphasize that as there are only a total of ~*four* rehearsals left for Rei Miyasaka and Alana Chan (2-3 each), everyone should be well adept with their parts. Regardless, continue practicing! :)
**Attendance for the following rehearsals are IMPERATIVE** unless there are emergencies or conflicting priorities. (Please contact us so we're aware) The month will pass by quick and it'll be concert day in a blink of an eye!


3. Despite school being off on the Remembrance Day weekend, **we will still have rehearsal on November 13th.**


4. Open Rehearsals - Fridays 12:30pm - 3:30pm in MBC 2290. Still ongoing!


5. Our second social event on November 10th will feature a few games, FREE FOOD/DRINKS and a screening of Howl's Moving Castle. Come find out the mystery of why so many are hyping a moving castle.

## Rehearsalana notes - October 3sp0oky5me:

### Oblivion (Not the Elder Scrolls one) [[listen here]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZ3GtwIEAo)
#### General
- There are a few transitions where the attention shifts between the solo (Andy) and the other strings, make sure this shift is emphasized as it can augment Andy's and the ensemble's overall expression.

#### Bar 1 & 55
- 1st violins; lean toward the E and immediately dim. The shaping of the phrase suggests a gradual increase toward the peak and a quickling falling dim.

#### Bar 19 & 43
- 1st and 2nd violins; similar to 1 & 55, pay attention to the contours and shape accordingly.

#### Bar 27
- The 1st beat will be delayed here (Pause prior, watch Alana)
- Add a gradual cresc. toward Bar 29

#### Bar 9
- 1st and 2nd violins; change mp to mf

#### Bar 36
- 1st and 2nd violins; more vibrato, more expression - the melody shifts from the solo to y'all

### Howl's Mobile Manor [[listen here]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5tTiYT1cgU)
#### General
- The key thing to watch for throughout this piece are the transitions. As there is an abundance of rubato/tempo changes, it is VERY easy to lose your footing. As Alana says, "The correct definition of a tempo is watch me." 10/10 she will guide you

#### Bar 63
- Strings too loud, don't get excited

#### Bar 71
- 1st and 2nd violins; pianissimo
- Strings that play the off-beat rhythms; up-bow for a lighter feel.

#### Bar 96
- Take your time, watch Alana as there are multiple temporal modulations in this area.

#### Bar 121
- Tutti; don't blast your instruments here (mf)

#### Bar 129
- Stronger dim.
- Horns; take your time and synchronize with the pulse

#### Bar 173
- Pay attention to the accel. here, it is subtle yet passes by very quick. UTMOST VIGILANCE.

#### Bar 178
- Tutti; don't drag (Thx trombones for keeping it up <3)

#### Bar 195-197
- The transition here is dependent on timpani, make sure to drive the cresc. after the fp

#### Bar 235
- Trombones; anticipate the pickup

<br/>

### Swan Lake [[listen here]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tzvebu6U08)
*legit there is a provincial park by this name in BC*
#### General
- Entrances are very important in this piece and it is very noticeable if an instrument is introduced incorrectly as it can be exposed from the overall timbre of the orchestra. Make sure articulations are clean as the changes are exposed as well.

#### Four bars after Rehearsal II
- Rit. then "a tempo" in the following bar

#### Eight bars before stringendo
- Trumpets; <> sausage/hairpin!

#### Bar 51
- Timpani FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-

#### Bar 38-41
- Bass; <> sausage every 2 bars

<br/>

<a name="rn4"/>
### Beethoven's 5.1

#### General
- Due to the abundance of distinct yet simultaneous melodies in the piece, it is very difficult to enter in time as you depend on other performers. It's not so much the conducting for this piece, but how your phrases fit into the web of other instruments' phrases. For this piece, LISTEN to the other instruments and BE CONFIDENT in your entrances. ðŸ’ª

#### Whole piece
- Be precise with the eighths, the pulse is strictly important here.
- Beethoven exaggerates his dynamic changes so emphasize it as written ("f to p" will usually mean "f to subito (sudden) p")

#### Bar 59
- Cellos; listen to the 1st violins for your entrance

#### Bar 84-94 & 332-346
- Bass; build that tension up boiii

#### Bar 399
- 1st and 2nd violins; emphasize the ascending notes. Feel the lighter rising motion that leads to the thump and the fall.
