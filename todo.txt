---------
Updates
---------
[] Update to Spring 2018 execs


---------
Fixes
---------

[] Mobile Contact Form
- Gets a 405 when trying to submit
- Probably because there's two forms that share the same ID

---------------
To Implement
---------------

[] Exec Archive
[] FAQ
[] Google Analytics
[] Developer wiki

---------------
Would be cool
---------------
[] Modal swipe
- On mobile, the modal windows (e.g. exec details) take up the full screen
- Would be cool if you could swipe between them

[] Interactive contact form

[] Footer stays at bottom of page regardless of content height

[x] Added X: Part 2 post | Completed 02-01-2018

[x] Mobile Nav | Completed 10-29-2017

[x] Post Page Layout | Completed 10-29-2017

[x] News/Events preview section on home page | Completed 10-16-2017

[x] Exec Section | Completed 10-01-2017
- Mobile layout looks clunky
- Should reduce thumbnail size and make it a two column layout with
names on the other column (especially since there's no hover on mobile)

[x] Exec Window | Completed: 9-28-2017
- Content overflows on small screen and gets cut off by the modal overlay
-- i.e. the overlay wraps over the modal window content at the bottom so the
text appears under the overlay at the bottom

[x] Navbar | Completed: 9-28-2017
- Contents get cut off to the right on small enough viewports
