---------
Fixes
---------

[] Mobile Contact Form
- Gets a 405 when trying to submit
- Probably because there's two forms that share the same ID

---------------
To Implement
---------------
[] Mobile Nav
[] News Archive
[] Exec Archive
[] FAQ
[] Google Analytics

---------------
Would be cool
---------------
[] Modal swipe
- On mobile, the modal windows (e.g. exec details) take up the full screen
- Would be cool if you could swipe between them

[] Interactive contact form

Archived Tasks
--------------

[x] Exec Section | Completed 10-01-2017
- Mobile layout looks clunky
- Should reduce thumbnail size and make it a two column layout with
names on the other column (especially since there's no hover on mobile)

[x] Exec Window | Completed: 9-28-2017
- Content overflows on small screen and gets cut off by the modal overlay
-- i.e. the overlay wraps over the modal window content at the bottom so the
text appears under the overlay at the bottom

[x] Navbar | Completed: 9-28-2017
- Contents get cut off to the right on small enough viewports
