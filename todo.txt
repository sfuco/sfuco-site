SFUCO Site TODO

---------
Fixes
---------
[] Navbar
- Contents get cut off to the right on small enough viewports

[] Exec Section
- Mobile layout looks clunky
- Should reduce thumbnail size and make it a two column layout with
names on the other column (especially since there's no hover on mobile)

---------------
To Implement
---------------
[] Mobile Nav
[] News Archive
[] Exec Archive

---------------
Would be cool
---------------
[] Modal swipe
- On mobile, the modal windows (e.g. exec details) take up the full screen
- Would be cool if you could swipe between them

[] Interactive contact form
