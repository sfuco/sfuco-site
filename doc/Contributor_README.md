# SFUCO Webpage - Content Contributor's Guide
## Getting Started
Interested in contributing? You'll need the following things:
- A text editor (like [Atom](https://atom.io/))
- [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)


### 'What do you mean I have to use a text editor?'
Content on the site is composed of an enhanced form of text files called *markdown* files. Here's what one looks like:

And here's what it'll look like on the site:

Neat huh?


### Creating Your Own News Posts
To make your own posts on the site, you just need to know two things:

#### 1. The Naming Convention
All posts have to follow this file naming convention: **yyyy-mm-dd-title.md** or else bad things happen.

#### 2. The Mechanics
If you remember from the example above, the post contained a header section that looked like this:

![yaml example](img/doc/yaml.png)

This header is known as *YAML Front Matter* (YAML stands for 'Yet Another Markup Language' if you're that curious). The *tags* enclosed between the three dashes on the top and bottom represent the post's metadata used in formatting purposes in the actual webpage.

For our news section, the only two tags you'll need to put in are the *title* and *category* tags. The latter should always say 'news' in order to show up so really all you have to do is put in your own title!

At this point, you're free to write your content underneath the YAML Front Matter (the header)! If you're just writing paragraphs then you can just write what you need to as is. For extra formatting, you can follow the [markdown syntax cheat sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).
